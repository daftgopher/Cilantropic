Cilantropic
===========

## A site that may or may not have anything to do with Cilantro

Thanks for trying out Cilantro. This is an app I made for my Ruby class at General Assembly. Woot. Hopefully it'll help you figure out what's for dinner, and maybe even inspire you to new heights of cullinary greatness. 

Featuring famous ingredients like:

- Cilantro!
- Beets!
- Butter!
- Hogwash!
- Even more Cilantro!

With Cilantro, you'll never starve again. Not like that last time. Also, everything is vegeterian here. It was the only cookbook I could find. :( 

Enjoy!
